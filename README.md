# Style Guide for OpenCollective App
You just need to open `index.html`

Basically, a style guide that sums up how every element designed for the OpenCollective app works.

You may find the following in the document:

* Grid
* Palette
* Forms
* Lists
* Icons
* Feedback
* Components
* Animations

Discussion about this is [highly encouraged.](https://github.com/OpenCollective/style-guide/issues)
